# Reference

Statistics on COVID-19 cases, Vaccinations etc using data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), for every country/location. 

For the Vaccination infographic, following the visualisation design of [Marta Fioni](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch), as featured on the [UK government equivalent dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

For the Impact of Vaccination analysis, following the visualisation design of [John Burn-Murdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch), as featured in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/fa4f248a-a476-491d-a5ce-f128360e9f24).

For Deaths vs Vaccinations scatter chart, inspired by a graphic in the NY Times article: [U.S. Coronavirus Death Toll Surpasses 700,000 Despite Wide Availability of Vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/us/us-covid-deaths-700k.html).

Categorisation of Countries into Income Groups is drawn from their latest classifaction present in the [World Income Inequality Database (WIID)](https://www.wider.unu.edu/database/world-income-inequality-database-wiid) - UNU-WIDER, World Income Inequality Database (WIID). Version 31 May 2021.

The Death Toll chart was inspired by a NY Times visualisation, showing each death as a small black point. The data source is the [Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations dataset from the Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/Data/STMF). To provide contrast to the Date axis, a random spread is introduced on the other axis.

# Summary

This project seeks to boil down the many figures on covid, vaccinations etc into easily digested infographics. 

On Hepatitis of unknown origin (NOVHEP), I was inspired by the visualisation produced by [Hiroshi Nishiura](https://twitter.com/nishiurah) which compared countries reporting NOVHEP with others in the OECD, against their Omicron case counts. [Here's his twitter thread explaining the method](https://twitter.com/nishiurah/status/1524905690438897665?s=20&t=unmXzT7iun3f2IDK8m2shw). My version includes all companies and all COVID case stats, so the user can choose their own perspective, e.g. vs Delta, other countries/continents etc etc.

On Vaccinations, the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

I started with a more detailed project for Australia. But the reality is that our challenge is global - vaccinating only selected populations will not control COVID-19. So this project has a global scope - any country/location or combination can be quickly compared on a "like-for-like" basis.

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Marta presents the vaccination data, standardised by the population of various Geographies.  Geographies of wildly differing populations (e.g. North America vs Australia) can be easily compared.

The Impact of Vaccination page contrasts two key statistics - Cases vs Deaths. Vaccinations reduce the number of cases somewhat, but should dramatically reduce the number of deaths that follow.

The [Stringency Index](https://ourworldindata.org/metrics-explained-covid19-stringency-index) curated by ourworldindata.org is presented as a quick summary of trends in restrictions and public health.

The Deaths vs Vaccinations page compares countries by deaths (per 2 million population, to help compare countries of different sizes) against their latest % fully vaccinated. You can filter the Countries by Income Group, Continent, Countries and population ranges to come up with any combination of countries desired. You can also adjust the date range.

For the Excess Death Toll, I started from the HMD dataset of weekly deaths by Country. I only use the Total Deaths figure. I derive the average of those results for 2015-2019, and then subtract it from the data for 2020 onwards, matched by week to derive "Excess Deaths". Negative results are dropped. This is a somewhat simplistic method, not trying to take into account long-term trends in mortality or population. From my understanding, these were previously combining to drive mortality downwards, so these results are probably an undercount.

An explorer page presents the Vaccination data for many countries at once for quick comparisons, featuring an interactive table.  Click the column headings to sort, use the slicer controls on the right to select.

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables on the 2nd page.  

The dataviz is refreshed automatically, roughly every 6 hours. 

I have similar projects running for other specific countries, in more detail:
 - [Australia](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-au-vaccinations#readme) (select country, state or territory)
 - [New Zealand](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-nz-vaccinations#readme) (select country, or Area/DHB) - discontinued after the source data was withdrawn
