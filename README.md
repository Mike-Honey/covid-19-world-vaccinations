**Reference:**

Data on Vaccinations from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), for every country/location. The data can also be aggregated

Following the visualisation design of [Marta Fioni](https://twitter.com/martafioni), as featured on the [UK government "equivalent" dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

**Summary**

This project seeks to boil down the many figures on vaccinations into an easily digested infographic. I've been looking for inspiration on this for quite a while - the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Marta presents the vaccination data, standardised by the population of various Geographies.  Geographies of wildly differing populations (e.g. North America vs Australia) can be easily compared.

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables on the 2nd page.  

The dataviz is refreshed automatically, roughly every 6 hours.
