**Reference:**

Infographic on COVID-19 Vaccinations, using data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), for every country/location. 

Following the visualisation design of [Marta Fioni](https://twitter.com/martafioni), as featured on the [UK government equivalent dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

**Summary**

This project seeks to boil down the many figures on vaccinations into an easily digested infographic. I've been looking for inspiration on this for quite a while - the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

I started with a more detailed project for Australia. But the reality is that our challenge is global - vaccinating only selected populations will not control COVID-19. So this project has a global scope - any country/location or combination can be quickly compared on a "like-for-like" basis.

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Marta presents the vaccination data, standardised by the population of various Geographies.  Geographies of wildly differing populations (e.g. North America vs Australia) can be easily compared.

An explorer page presents the same data for many countries at once for quick comparisons, featuring an interactive table.  Click the column headings to sort, use the slicer controls on the right to select.

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables on the 2nd page.  

The dataviz is refreshed automatically, roughly every 6 hours. 

I have similar projects running for other specific countries, in more detail:
 - [Australia](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-au-vaccinations#readme) (select country, state or territory)
 - [New Zealand](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-nz-vaccinations#readme) (select country, or Area/DHB)
